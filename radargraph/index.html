              <p>As a marker in a course, where you may not have set the assessment but are delivering on behalf of a

              <p>To approach this constructively, the following feedback may be helpful.</p>

              <p>Discuss the timing of due dates for assessment tasks with the Course Coordinator. Determine whether or
                not there is an achievable distribution in the workload for students.</p>

              <p>As a marker, you have a unique view into identifying student submission patterns and to identify common
                student mistakes in assessment tasks. Identifying whether or not there are certain tasks that students
                struggle to complete on time? Or are there some lower weighted assessments which students choose not to
                do because they are time poor?</p>

              <p>When you are reviewing batches of assessments, you might notice some patterns that indicate, with
                subtle changes students may have the opportunity to complete tasks. This might include making the task
                available to students earlier.</p>

              <p>Discuss the workload distribution with students during tutorials. Provide them with realistic advice

                with preparation for assessment. This includes resources to support students in time management, exam
                preparation. Encourage students to stay on top of their coursework by drawing out the links between the
                course coursework and assessment items. You can also direct students to resources which relate to each
                assignment. Or, how to find the resources required for the assignment, e.g. <a

                “low-stakes” assessments which some students choose not to complete because they are time poor? If this
                is the case, you need to reconsider the timing of the assessments in this course with the programme/s of
                study in mind. You might also need to reconsider assessment weightings so that students consider all

              <h3>Feedback</h3>

              <p>As a marker, you will be asked to provide feedback on students’ assessment items. To improve the way
                that you deliver feedback to students the following suggestions may be helpful.</p>

              <p>If you are new to marking, you might like to read David J. Nicol & Debra Macfarlane‐Dick (2006)
                Formative assessment and self‐regulated learning: a model and seven principles of good feedback
                practice, Studies in Higher Education, 31:2, 199-218, DOI: 10.1080/03075070600572090</p>

              <p>Students benefit from clear and helpful feedback on their learning. Feedback can be delivered in many
                formats, informal or formal, written or verbal, in person or via technology. Carefully consider the way
                that you deliver feedback so that it is accurate, actionable and relevant.</p>

              <p>When writing feedback include specific information about when students will have the opportunity to act
                on the feedback you have provided. This might include an opportunity for resubmission or an assessment
                task that is held later in the course where they can action your feedback.</p>

              <p>This includes considering the tone, timeliness and specificity of the feedback. It is preferable to
                provide specific feedback that a student can apply. Rather than saying, “Well done!” try, “This is a
                constructive argument with a logical and convincing conclusion.” Vague comments are not instructive and
                students will not know what it is that they need to improve upon. Relate the feedback to the learning
                outcomes for the course and how the student is progressing toward achieving these.</p>

              <p>Make sure that you are familiar with the tools that are used for marking. When using digital tools,
                make sure that you know the full range of functionality of the tools. When marking online, you can use a
                comment bank. This can ensure consistency of feedback to students. Digital tools also have features such
                as video and audio recording. This can personalise and enhance the feedback for students.</p>

              <p>It is often helpful to have marking rubric when assessing a student’s work. Make sure that you are
                familiar with the rubric criteria and the range of points available for each. Discuss the assessment
                requirements with the Course Coordinator to ensure that you meet their expectations when assessing
                student work. This includes when grades or marks and accompanying feedback will be made available to
                students.</p>

              <p>Do not rely on a single score as feedback. A mark or a grade does not provide a student with sufficient
                guidance for improvement.</p>

              <p>Make sure that you are aware of the marking process, for example if there will be more than one marker
                or if there is double blind marking required. </p>

              <p>Given the amount of time and effort taken to mark a student’s work and provide detailed feedback,
                discuss with the Course Coordinator how students will be encouraged to review their feedback. If the
                work is formative or held earlier in the study period, later assessment items can include a requirement
                for students to reflect upon their feedback. This reinforces student learning and application of
                feedback.</p>

              <h3>Feedback</h3>

              <p>As a tutor, you may be asked to provide feedback on students’ assessment items. To improve the way that
                you deliver feedback to students the following suggestions may be helpful.</p>
              <p>Students benefit from clear and explicit feedback on their learning. Feedback can be delivered in many
                formats, informal or formal, written or verbal, in person or via technology. Carefully consider the way
                that you deliver feedback so that it is accurate, actionable and relevant.</p>
              <p>This includes considering the tone, timeliness and specificity of the feedback. It is preferable to
                provide specific feedback that a student can apply. Rather than saying, “Well done!” try, “This is a
                constructive argument with a logical and convincing conclusion.” Vague comments are not instructive and
                students will not know what it is that they need to improve upon. Relate the feedback to the learning
                outcomes for the course and how the student is progressing toward achieving these.</p>
              <p>If your role as tutor requires that you mark assessment, make sure that you are familiar with the tools
                that are used for marking. When using digital tools, make sure that you know the full range of
                functionality available. When marking online, you can use a comment bank. This can ensure consistency of
                feedback to students. Digital tools also have features such as video and audio recording. This can
                personalise and enhance the feedback for students.</p>
              <p>It is often helpful to have marking rubric when assessing a student’s work. Make sure that you are
                familiar with the rubric criteria and the range of points available for each. Discuss the assessment
                requirements with the Course Coordinator to ensure that you meet their expectations when assessing
                student work. This includes when grades or marks and accompanying feedback will be made available to
                students.</p>
              <p>Do not rely on a single score as feedback. A mark or a grade does not provide a student with sufficient
                guidance for improvement.</p>
              <p>Make sure that you are aware of the marking process, for example if there will be more than one marker
                or if there is double blind marking required.</p>
              <p>Given the amount of time and effort taken to mark a student’s work and provide detailed feedback,
                discuss with the Course Coordinator how students will be encouraged to review their feedback. If the
                work is formative or held earlier in the study period, later assessment items can include a requirement
                for students to reflect upon their feedback. This reinforces student learning and application of
                feedback.</p>

              <p>As the Course Coordinator it is your responsibility to ensure that constructive feedback is provided to
                each student in MyUni after each assessment task. This feedback should enable them to improve. In some
                courses, you will provide this feedback. In others you will need to support markers and tutors to
                provide this feedback.</p>
              <p>To approach this constructively, consider the following recommendations.</p>
              <p>Encourage tutors and markers to work together. Clearly explain the requirements of each assessment item
                to them. Provide opportunities for them to meet to discuss your expectations of the roles and the
                purpose of the assessment tasks and the way that they have been designed to be delivered to students.
                Explain the importance of consistency in the provision of feedback to students.</p>
              <p>You may also start to incorporate feedback from students into your assessment practice. The University
                of Adelaide has adopted a <a
                  href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/learning-enhancement-innovation/student-partnerships"
                  target="_blank"> Students as Partners Framework</a>. Student partnership activities can include
                co-designing and co-developing assessment items with previous students or current students. This can be
                done in a variety of ways, having students generate practice questions for tests or having students
                suggest new modes of delivering your assessment tasks. This can also be done in conjunction with a
                Learning Designer</p>

                courses, you will provide this feedback. In others you will need to support markers and tutors to
                provide this feedback.</p>
              <p>To approach this constructively, consider the following recommendations.</p>
              <p>Provide clear assessment criteria to students before they complete each assessment. These criteria
                should be explicitly aligned with the course learning outcomes. Rubrics are an effective way to provide
                this information. Clear assessment criteria will enable you (and the markers and/or tutors) to provide
                very specific feedback to students. How have they met the criteria? How could they improve their
                submission? What gaps in their learning does their submission identify? What course content do they need
                to revise to fill these gaps?</p>
              <p>Provide feedback which encourages students to take action. What can they do to better demonstrate their
                learning and/or competency in a future assessment?</p>
              <p>Provide opportunities for students to view and discuss exemplars. This will help develop their ability
                to judge the quality of their own work and the work of others against agreed standards. How does an
                (exemplar) submission meet the assessment criteria? What makes it exemplary? What
                knowledge/skills/competencies are required to achieve this standard?</p>
              <p>Prepare marking guides for your markers and encourage them to communicate with you and with each other
                to provide consistency in feedback.</p>
              <p>Consider delivering feedback in a range of formats- informal or formal, written or verbal, in person or
                via technology e.g. video or audio recording.</p>
              <p>Provide opportunities for students to develop the skills required for self and peer assessment and
                encourage them to reflect on the feedback provided.</p>
              <p>Remember that feedback needs to be much more than just a mark or a grade as these do not help students
                improve.</p>
              <p>Consider further developing your own skills in providing quality feedback. <a

              <p>As a marker in a course, you will encounter a wide variety of student work.</p>

              <p>To assess the needs of a wide variety of student learners, the following feedback may be helpful.</p>

              <p>To ensure that all can engage equitably with assessment tasks, the expectations around what is required
                for success in any discipline need to be made explicit and accessible to students. It is important to
                provide opportunities for them to develop the academic skills they require to perform those tasks.</p>


              <p>
                One way that you can improve accessibility, is to ask the Course Coordinator if they have used the <a
                  href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-Accessibility-Checker-in-the-Rich-Content/ta-p/820"

                for improvement. This will help to ensure that assessment tasks are accessible.
              </p>

              <p>You could also offer to review the instructions for the assessment items in the course. This may help
                to determine whether or not the instructions are clear for students. Follow the instructions as they are
                written and see if there is anything that is unclear or steps that are missing.</p>

              <p>As a marker, you may also be able to either take the assessment task as though you were a student. Time
                yourself. Are the time limits set reasonable for a student to achieve? An expert can often complete a
                task in one third of the time it takes a novice. You may suggest revising the times accordingly.</p>

              <p>Markers can also be useful in picking up errors in assessment tasks. We are all human and mistakes can
                be made. Having another pair of eyes checking an assessment can be helpful for staff and students.</p>

              <p>If assessments are supported by technologies, make sure that access to these is not a barrier to

              <p>As the Course Coordinator it is your responsibility to design quality assessments which meet the
                requirements of the <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/policies/700/" target="_blank">Assessment for
                  Coursework Programs Policy</a>. Authentic assessment approaches are recommended. These are
                characterised by students demonstrating the ability to apply knowledge and skills in a realistic way
                according to explicitly stated criteria.</p>
              <p>The following feedback may be helpful to increase the authenticity of assessment tasks.</p>
              <p>Consult with industry partners wherever possible in the course and assessment design process. What
                knowledge and skills do future employees need? What will they need to be able to produce in the
                workplace? Can your industry partners provide examples of work or workplace scenarios to motivate
                students?</p>
              <p>Become familiar with latest trends in industry, including project manage methods, software, or other
                work practices that you can replicate or introduce into assessment tasks to prepare students for their
                career.</p>
              <p>To support your own professional development in this area, consider taking the ADEPT course in
                Designing and Delivering quality Work Integrated Learning experiences. This module covers WIL models,
                assessment ideas for practice and innovation in WIL. This would be a great extension to your existing
                assessment practice.</p>

              <p>As the Course Coordinator it is your responsibility to design quality assessments which meet the requirements of the <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/policies/700/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Assessment for Coursework Programs Policy</a>. Authentic assessment approaches are recommended. These are characterised by students demonstrating the ability to apply knowledge and skills in a realistic way according to explicitly stated criteria.</p>
<p>The following feedback may be helpful to increase the authenticity of assessment tasks.</p>
<p>Consider assessments to be learning opportunities in themselves, engaging students to apply knowledge and skills to produce something which has real world meaning and relevance to the workplace. Are students motivated by the assessment tasks? Is the real world application clear to them?</p>
<p>Provide ongoing opportunities for students to practise applying knowledge and skills by scaffolding authentic assessments throughout the course and providing feedback supporting students to improve.</p>
<p>Consult with industry partners wherever possible in the course and assessment design process. What knowledge and skills do their future employees need? What will they need to be able to produce in the workplace? Can your industry partners provide examples of work or workplace scenarios to motivate students?</p>
